## Preparation
* Import requests and csv  
* Register for Openweather Map API to get an API key.
## API
The API I use here is current weather data
<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/BUEC500C1/api-design-ZhenfeiYu/blob/master/weatherapi.png"/></div>
With this API, the user can get current weather condition of a specific airport.
## Example 
Run weatherAPI.py and enter the airport name you want to check.
